# EvadeDroid
This is a tool for generating Android adversarial examples in a black-box setting. The source code is currently being prepared to be open-sourced. We will gradually push it into the repository as it is ready.

## Installation
1. Install Python 3 (>= 3.6) in your machine, which can be either Windows or Linux. Note for using Windows machine, the codes related to parallelizing (e.g., '''Python mp = torch.multiprocessing.get_context('forkserver')''') should be cut.
